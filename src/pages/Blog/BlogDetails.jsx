## Introduction: A Digital Double-Edged Sword

Bangladesh has witnessed an extraordinary digital transformation over the last decade. From 
bustling megacities to remote rural villages, smartphones and social media have connected 
people like never before.
With over **130 million internet subscribers**, it is a digital nation in every sense.  
But alongside opportunities lurks a darker reality: **the rise of cyberbullying**.

---

## Defining Cyberbullying in the Bangladeshi Context
At its core, cyberbullying refers to intentional, repeated harm inflicted through digital technologies.  
Common forms include:
- Harassment and abuse via Facebook, TikTok, or Messenger.  
- Impersonation through fake accounts to spread misinformation.  
- Image-based abuse, including revenge porn and doctored photos.  
- Threats and blackmail, often linked with extortion.  
- Targeted hate speech based on gender, religion, or ethnicity.  

Victims—especially women and youth—face **trauma, stigma, and reputational damage**.

---

## The Scope of the Problem
- **40% rise** in online harassment complaints (BTRC, 2022–24).  
- PCSW receives **hundreds of cases monthly**, mostly Facebook-related.  
- **70% of victims are women** (The Daily Star, 2024).  

These are not just statistics—they are students, professionals, and families suffering in silence.

---

## Real Stories, Real Harm
- A Dhaka student attempted suicide after fake images spread online.  
- Rajshahi boys mocked classmates on TikTok; reputations damaged.  
- A Chattogram businessman blackmailed with doctored documents.  

Cyberbullying is borderless—and its scars are real.

---

## Why Cyberbullying Is Growing
1. **Digital Explosion** — Cheap data, smartphones, but low digital literacy.  
2. **Cultural Stigma** — Victims, esp. women, hesitate to report.  
3. **Weak Enforcement** — Delays, lack of trained officers.  
4. **Anonymity of Platforms** — Fake accounts, encrypted apps.  
5. **Lack of Awareness** — Victims don’t know official channels.  

---

## Consequences: Beyond the Screen
- Mental health: anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation.  
- Education: students skip or drop out.  
- Economy: professionals withdraw from digital platforms.  
- Society: erosion of trust in online spaces.  

A WHO Bangladesh report (2024) found **15% of adolescents had suicidal thoughts linked to cyberbullying**.

---

## Current Response Mechanisms
- **CSO 2025**: Bangladesh’s strongest cyber law yet.  
- **PCSW hotline**: 01320-000888, email complaint system.  
- **CID Cyber Police Centre** and **ATU cyber desk**.  
- NGOs & youth awareness campaigns.  

Yet **awareness and accessibility** remain challenges.

---

## Global Lessons
- **StopNCII.org** prevents spread of intimate images.  
- **Australia’s eSafety Commissioner**: legal takedowns.  
- **India’s Cybercrime Portal**: anonymous complaints.  

Bangladesh needs a **centralised citizen-friendly platform** — exactly what CyberShield envisions.

---

## The Way Forward
1. Awareness campaigns in schools/universities.  
2. Unified reporting portal linked to PCSW, CID, ATU.  
3. Faster takedown agreements with platforms.  
4. Counselling support integrated into responses.  
5. Training for parents, NGOs, youth clubs.  

---

## Conclusion: Why It Matters Now
Cyberbullying is a **national concern**, not a fringe issue.  
Bangladesh’s digital revolution must uplift — not harm.  
Every citizen deserves to log in **without fear**.

## Introduction: A Digital Nation Faces Digital Threats

Bangladesh’s rapid digitalisation has transformed daily life, empowering citizens with 
unprecedented connectivity. With over 130 million internet users, social media and digital 
platforms are now integral to communication, business, and governance. Yet, with these 
advancements came a sharp rise in cybercrime—particularly cyberbullying, online harassment, 
financial fraud, and disinformation. 


Bangladesh’s legal framework has rapidly evolved:  
- **DSA 2018** → controversial, vague.  
- **CSA 2023** → attempted reform.  
- **CSO 2025** → strongest yet, victim-centric.  

---

## DSA 2018
**Strengths:**  
- Legal basis against cyber harassment.  
- Non-consensual intimate image sharing criminalised.  

**Challenges:**  
- Vague definitions.  
- Misuse against journalists.  
- Slow justice for victims.  

---

## CSA 2023
**Reforms:**  
- Clearer definitions.  
- Reduced non-bailable offences.  
- Stronger focus on harassment & image abuse.  

**Challenges:**  
- Awareness gaps.  
- Institutional capacity lag.  

---

## CSO 2025
**Features:**  
1. Defines cyberbullying, deepfake abuse.  
2. Faster takedowns.  
3. Victim-centred safeguards.  
4. Data protection principles.  

**Impact:**  
- Rapid takedowns (e.g., deepfake case in Dhaka).  
- 1,200 cyber harassment cases filed in 3 months.  
- Universities drafting digital safety policies.  

---

## Conclusion
CSO 2025 is **Bangladesh’s strongest shield yet**, but training, awareness, and fair enforcement remain challenges.

## Introduction: When a Like Turns into a Threat

In Bangladesh, Facebook is more than a social media platform—it’s the nation’s digital public 
square. From sharing family photos to running businesses, Facebook connects millions. But for 
many young people, this connection has turned into a source of fear. One striking case from 
Dhaka demonstrates just how dangerous cyberbullying and blackmail can be when anonymity 
and malice collide. 


Facebook connects millions in Bangladesh—but also enables harassment.  
In 2024, a **19-year-old Dhaka student** was blackmailed with fake photos.  

---

## The Case
- Fake Facebook account created with edited photos.  
- Blackmailer demanded bKash payment.  
- Victim considered leaving college.  

---

## PCSW Response
1. Collected evidence (screenshots, links).  
2. Traced IP of offender.  
3. Coordinated with Facebook → suspended account.  
4. Arrested suspect within **72 hours**.  

---

## Why It Matters
- Crime is **low-tech but devastating**.  
- Women are disproportionately affected.  
- Rapid intervention saved the victim.  

---

## Legal Framework
- CSO 2025: cyberbullying, impersonation, image abuse, extortion.  
- Pornography Control Act 2012.  
- Stronger penalties under new framework.  

---

## Lessons
- Early reporting saves lives.  
- Preserve evidence.  
- Many perpetrators are peers, not strangers.  

---

## Global Lessons
- India: Cyber helpline 1930.  
- UK: Revenge Porn Helpline.  
- Australia: eSafety Commissioner with takedown powers.  

---

## Conclusion
This case shows how **justice at the speed of tech** is possible.  
With PCSW’s swift action, the victim found safety.
